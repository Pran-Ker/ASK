# Excom
Our idea is a common chat feature present on any website. The aim is to let users chat with each other through a web extension linked to the website that they are present on. This means that users visiting similar websites can see the comments made by others and reply back to them. It will create a singular platform for conversation, and is particularly helpful if the website does not have a chat feature.
