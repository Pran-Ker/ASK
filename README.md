## Idea
Our idea is a common chat feature present on any website. The aim is to let users chat with each other through a web extension linked to the website that they are present on. This means that users visiting similar websites can see the comments made by others and reply back to them. It will create a singular platform for conversation, and is particularly helpful if the website does not have a chat feature.


## Example:
1. Let us take the example of a fresher, who is interested in finding out more details through https://csivit.com. However, as there is no chat feature it is difficult to ask. Using the extension, different users can answer for them and have conversations.

2. On many forums or news websites comments are allowed on the website, but are often censored. The extension will allow users to bypass the censorship and write comments.

## Implementation:
1. Creating a web application which allows for chatting.
2. Hosting it as a website, and allowing for over the internet communication.
3. AWS SQL database that stores comments temporarily will be made.
4. Javascript or python based program that recognizes the particular website and creates a chat room.
5. Additional features like sending of pictures, videos, suggestions.
6. Submitting as chrome extension
